# 8Puzzle_Game_With_AI
The project is A Game called "8PuzzleGame". The 8-puzzle is a square board with 9 positions, filled by 8 numbered tiles and one gap. At any
point, a tile adjacent to the gap can be moved into the gap, creating a new gap position. In other
words, the gap can be swapped with an adjacent (horizontally and vertically) tile. The objective in
the game is to begin with an arbitrary configuration of tiles and move them to get the numbered
tiles arranged in ascending order either running around the perimeter of the board or ordered from
left to right, with 1 in the top left-hand position.

### Quick Start
```bash
# clone repo
$ git clone https://github.com/AhmadMaree/8Puzzle_Game_With_AI

# change directory to cloned app
$ cd CoConstructApp

# install the dependencies 

# start Android emulator with running App

### Algorithm

We use A* Searching Algorithm for build this game .The A* searching algorithm is a recursive algorithm that continuously calls itself until a winning state is found. When the game is designed, in order to randomly generate different games, start with the goal state and make many random moves on the state.
